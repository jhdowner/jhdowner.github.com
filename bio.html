<title>James Downer's Bio</title>
<h1>A Quick Bio for James Downer</h1>

<body>
<p>Born in the backwoods of Maine in the early 1990s, it is well know that James Downer was soon after left by his birth parents to fend for himself.  Only a toddler at the time, he crawled about the forest foraging on wild berries and mushrooms.  One day, while wandering the forest, he stumbled upon a wolves' den and was subsequently adopted.  All was well for a while as he grew and played with the wolf pups until one day a grizzly bear came to the wolves' den and demanded the 'boy-cub' as a mid-afternoon snack. The wolf family scared off the bear that day, but the bear vowed revenge.</p>
<p>Years later, James had grown spent much time wandering the forest and the bear came back for his revenge.  As he did not fear fire, James ran to a nearby village and stole a burning torch.  He chased the bear from the forest with the burning stick.  When he looked around, the wolves which had once been his family cowered in fear of him and his fire-stick.  He realized sadly that he must leave the forest for good and join the world of men.</p>
<p>Soon after, he enrolled in Tufts and there he remains to the day, waiting for the moment that he can return to the forest</p>
